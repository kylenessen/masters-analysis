# Data Preparation Refactoring Summary

## Problem Statement

The original `data_prep_complete_days.qmd` script had several issues:
- **Discrepant outputs**: Different CSV files with varying row counts (1,824 vs 2,098 rows)
- **Excessive complexity**: 770+ lines consolidating 4 different scripts
- **Performance bottleneck**: Wind feature calculation looped through each row individually (30+ minute runtime)
- **Logic inconsistencies**: Subtle differences between consolidated and individual scripts
- **Column handling errors**: Missing deployment_id issues in joins

## Original File Comparison

| File | Rows | Issues |
|------|------|---------|
| `analysis_complete_days.csv` | 1,824 | Missing records, inconsistent filtering |
| `analysis_dataset_final.csv` | 2,098 | Different complete day logic |
| `butterfly_abundance_complete_days.csv` | 2,230 | Base data before wind processing |

## Solution: Streamlined Data Preparation

Created `data_prep_fixed.qmd` with the following improvements:

### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- **Wind processing**: Reduced from 30+ minutes to ~3 minutes (10x speedup)
- **Memory efficiency**: Eliminated redundant data copies
- **Parallel processing**: Optimized butterfly abundance parsing

### 2. **Code Simplification**
- **Reduced complexity**: From 770+ lines to ~400 lines
- **Single source of truth**: Eliminated duplicate logic
- **Unified pipeline**: All filtering in one coherent flow

### 3. **Consistency Fixes**
- **Complete days logic**: Single, consistent implementation
- **Column handling**: Fixed deployment_id join issues
- **Filtering pipeline**: Unified night filtering and downsampling

### 4. **Data Quality Improvements**
- **Better error handling**: Graceful handling of parsing failures
- **Validation**: Built-in data completeness checks
- **Debugging**: Clear progress indicators and column tracking

## Final Output

**File**: `analysis_complete_days_streamlined.csv`
- **Rows**: 1,708 data rows
- **Columns**: 17 features
- **Complete days only**: Properly filtered for middle days with observations before and after
- **Wind features**: All observations have valid 30-minute wind data
- **Data integrity**: Consistent logic throughout pipeline

### Column Structure:
```
deployment_id, image_filename, total_butterflies, butterflies_direct_sun, 
timestamp, day_id, AR_start, wind_mean, wind_max_gust, wind_sd, 
gust_differential_mean, cumulative_wind, time_above_threshold, 
temperature, Observer, view_id, proportion_butterflies_direct_sun
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated redundancy**: No more duplicate deployment combination logic between R and Python
2. **Fixed data flow**: Proper column preservation throughout the pipeline  
3. **Optimized wind processing**: Efficient time window calculations
4. **Consistent complete days**: Single definition applied uniformly
5. **Better maintainability**: Clear, readable code structure

## Performance Gains

| Aspect | Original | Streamlined | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Runtime | 30+ minutes | ~3 minutes | 10x faster |
| Code lines | 770+ | ~400 | ~50% reduction |
| Memory usage | High (multiple copies) | Optimized | Significant reduction |
| Maintainability | Poor (scattered logic) | Good (unified) | Major improvement |

## Files Created/Updated

- ✅ `data_prep_fixed.qmd` - Main streamlined script
- ✅ `analysis_complete_days_streamlined.csv` - Final cleaned dataset
- ✅ `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Usage

To use the streamlined script:

```bash
quarto render data_prep_fixed.qmd
```

This will generate:
- `data_prep_fixed.html` - Documentation with validation plots
- `analysis_complete_days_streamlined.csv` - Clean dataset for analysis

The streamlined dataset is now ready for downstream statistical modeling with consistent, high-quality data and proper complete days filtering.
