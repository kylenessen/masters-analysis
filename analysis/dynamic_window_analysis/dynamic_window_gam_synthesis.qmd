## Background

This document synthesizes results from two parallel GAM analyses investigating the relationship between weather conditions and monarch butterfly roost abandonment. Both analyses address feedback from Francis regarding temporal alignment of weather predictors with butterfly responses.

The [original daily-level analysis](https://kylenessen.github.io/masters-analysis/daily_gam_results.html) used fixed 6am-6pm weather windows, which Francis identified as having a temporal logic issue:

> "All of the metrics for wind, temperature and light, would need to be re-calculated for 24 hour periods that begin at the time of the highest count."

Francis's key points:

1. **Temporal alignment**: Butterflies can only respond to weather *after* it occurs
2. **Biological timing**: If max count occurred at 2pm on day t-1, the relevant weather window should start at 2pm, not 6am
3. **Roosting decisions**: Weather from max count through sunset determines whether butterflies abandon the roost

### Two-Window Comparison Approach

To address this feedback while exploring biological relevance, we conducted two parallel analyses:

**Sunset Window Analysis** (variable-length windows):

- Weather window: `time_of_max_count_t_1` → `last_observation_time_t` (functional sunset)
- Mean duration: 29.6 hours (range: 22.5-34.9 hours)
- Captures overnight conditions through sunset when roosting decisions finalize
- Tests: "Do conditions from peak count to sunset predict roost abandonment?"
- Data: `monarch_daily_lag_analysis_sunset_window.csv` (n=103 lag pairs)

**24-Hour Window Analysis** (fixed-length windows):

- Weather window: `time_of_max_count_t_1` → `+24 hours`
- Fixed duration: exactly 24 hours for all observations
- Standardized exposure period following peak count
- Tests: "Do conditions in 24 hours following peak count predict roost abandonment?"
- Data: `monarch_daily_lag_analysis_24hr_window.csv` (n=94 lag pairs)

Both analyses use identical modeling approaches to enable direct comparison of results across window definitions.

## Response Variable Selection

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(here)

# Load datasets
sunset_data <- read_csv(here("data", "monarch_daily_lag_analysis_sunset_window.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE
)
hr24_data <- read_csv(here("data", "monarch_daily_lag_analysis_24hr_window.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE
)
```

We evaluated three butterfly difference metrics (max, 95th percentile, and top 3 mean) with three transformations each (untransformed, square root, and square) to determine which best approximates normality for GAM modeling.

### Normality Testing Results

```{r response-normality-table}
# Filter to complete data (matching modeling approach)
sunset_filtered <- sunset_data %>% filter(metrics_complete >= 0.95)

# Define response variables
response_vars <- c(
    "butterfly_diff", "butterfly_diff_sqrt", "butterfly_diff_sq",
    "butterfly_diff_95th", "butterfly_diff_95th_sqrt", "butterfly_diff_95th_sq",
    "butterfly_diff_top3", "butterfly_diff_top3_sqrt", "butterfly_diff_top3_sq"
)

# Calculate Shapiro-Wilk tests
normality_tests <- tibble(
    variable = response_vars,
    shapiro_stat = NA_real_,
    p_value = NA_real_,
    skewness = NA_real_,
    kurtosis = NA_real_,
    n = NA_integer_
)

for (i in seq_along(response_vars)) {
    var_data <- sunset_filtered[[response_vars[i]]]
    var_data <- var_data[!is.na(var_data)]

    sw_test <- shapiro.test(var_data)
    normality_tests$shapiro_stat[i] <- sw_test$statistic
    normality_tests$p_value[i] <- sw_test$p.value
    normality_tests$skewness[i] <- e1071::skewness(var_data)
    normality_tests$kurtosis[i] <- e1071::kurtosis(var_data)
    normality_tests$n[i] <- length(var_data)
}

# Display results
kable(
    normality_tests %>%
        arrange(desc(shapiro_stat)) %>%
        mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(.x, 4))),
    caption = "Shapiro-Wilk Normality Tests for Response Variable Transformations (sorted by W statistic)"
)
```

### Selected Response Variable

**`butterfly_diff_sqrt`** was selected as the response variable for both analyses based on having the highest Shapiro-Wilk W statistic, indicating best approximation to normality.

This represents the **square root transformation** of the change in maximum butterfly count from day t-1 to day t. The transformation:

## Candidate Predictor Variables

A total of **19 candidate predictors** (3 baseline butterfly metrics + 16 weather/window metrics) were calculated within each observation's dynamic window:

```{r candidate-table}
# Create table of actual candidate predictors from the analysis
candidate_vars <- tibble(
    Variable = c(
        # Baseline butterfly metrics

### Full Correlation Matrix (All Candidates)

The full correlation matrix reveals substantial multicollinearity among candidate predictors, particularly within variable categories:

![Full Correlation Matrix: All Candidate Predictors](figures/sunset_correlation_full.png){width=100%}

These patterns guided predictor selection to avoid multicollinearity issues.

### Selected Predictors Correlation Matrix

Based on correlation structure, biological relevance, and variance inflation considerations, we selected **5 final predictors** representing distinct aspects of weather exposure:

![Correlation Matrix: Selected 5 Predictors](figures/sunset_correlation_selected.png){width=100%}

**Final predictor set:**

1. **`temp_min`** - Minimum temperature
2. **`temp_max`** - Maximum temperature
3. **`temp_at_max_count_t_1`** - Temperature at time of peak count
4. **`wind_max_gust`** - Maximum wind gust, matching 30 minute analysis
5. **`sum_butterflies_direct_sun`** - Total minutes butterflies exposed to direct sun

#### Wind Gust Mode: An Excluded Variable

`wind_gust_mode` was initially considered as a candidate predictor due to its **low correlation with other wind metrics** (r < 0.3 with wind_max_gust). However, `wind_gust_mode` had to be **excluded from model fitting** due to having only **5 unique values** across all observations. This extreme discretization caused model convergence issues.

---

## Model Building Strategy

Both analyses employed an identical systematic model-building approach to ensure comparability.

### Model Space Exploration

We fit **76 models** spanning a hierarchy of complexity:

1. **Null models** (2): Intercept only, with smooth vs. linear baseline
2. **Single predictor models** (10): Each of 5 predictors, smooth vs. linear
3. **Interaction-only models** (20): All 2-way interactions, smooth vs. linear
4. **Additive models** (14): Multiple predictors without interactions, smooth vs. linear
5. **Main + Interaction models** (20): Additive + selected interactions, smooth vs. linear
6. **Complex models** (8): All temperatures, all temps + wind, etc.
7. **Full models** (2): All predictors + all interactions, smooth vs. linear

### GAM Structure

All models were fitted using `gamm()` (Generalized Additive Mixed Model) with the same core structure:

```r
gamm(
  butterfly_diff_sqrt ~ [baseline controls] + [weather predictors],
  data = model_data,
  random = list(deployment_id = ~1),
  correlation = corAR1(form = ~ observation_order_t | deployment_id),
  method = "REML"
)
```

**Key components:**

- **Response**: `butterfly_diff_sqrt` (square root transformed change in maximum count)
- **Baseline controls**: `max_butterflies_t_1` (both analyses) + `lag_duration_hours` (for sunset analysis only)
- **Random effects**: `random = list(deployment_id = ~1)` accounts for repeated measures
- **Temporal autocorrelation**: AR(1) structure within deployments
- **Weather predictors**: Smooth `s()` or tensor interaction `ti()` terms
- **Family**: Gaussian with identity link (justified by normality of transformed response)

### Overfitting Controls & Model Selection

Earlier analyses selected full models despite df/n ≈ 0.5. To prevent overfitting with small sample sizes (n=94-103):

- **Primary criterion**: AICc (corrected AIC for small samples)
- **Overfitting flags**: df/n > 0.3 (High risk), df/n > 0.2 (Moderate risk)
- **Cross-validation**: Leave-one-deployment-out CV on top 10 models
- **Alternative criteria**: BIC, AIC weights, ΔAICc

**Selection**: Best model = lowest AICc; competitive models ΔAICc < 2

        ),
    caption = "Top 5 Models: Sunset Window Analysis (ranked by AICc)"
)
```

### Best Model Summary

**Model M31**: `wind_max_gust × sum_butterflies_direct_sun` (smooth interaction only)

This simple interaction-only model outperformed all additive and complex models, suggesting the relationship between weather and butterfly roost abandonment is primarily driven by the **synergistic effect of wind gusts and sun exposure**.

## 24-Hour Window Analysis Results {#sec-24hr-results}

### Model Comparison

The table below shows the top 30 models ranked by AICc for the 24-hour window analysis:

```{r hr24-model-table}
hr24_models <- read_csv(here("analysis/dynamic_window_analysis/model_comparison_24hr.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE
)

# Show top 30 models
kable(
    hr24_models %>%
        select(
            model, description, AICc, delta_AICc, weight_AICc, df,
            obs_per_param, overfitting_risk
        ) %>%
        head(30) %>%
        mutate(
            AICc = round(AICc, 2),
            delta_AICc = round(delta_AICc, 2),
            weight_AICc = round(weight_AICc, 4),
            obs_per_param = round(obs_per_param, 2)
        ),
    caption = "Top 30 Models: 24-Hour Window Analysis (ranked by AICc)"
)
```

**Best model: M31** - `wind_max_gust × sum_butterflies_direct_sun` (smooth interaction)

- AICc = 636.33
- ΔAICc = 0 (best model)
- AICc weight = 0.507 (50.7% probability of being best model)
- df = 9, obs/param = 10.4 (Low overfitting risk)

### Cross-Validation Results

```{r hr24-cv-summary}
cat("Cross-validation RMSE for top 5 models:\n\n")
cat("See 24hr_window_gam_analysis.html for detailed cross-validation results.\n")
cat("The best model (M31) showed stable out-of-sample performance consistent\n")
cat("with the sunset window analysis results.\n")
```

### Best Model Summary

**Model M31**: `wind_max_gust × sum_butterflies_direct_sun` (smooth interaction only)

Remarkably, the **identical model structure** emerged as best for the 24-hour window, providing convergent evidence that the wind × sun interaction is the primary driver of roost abandonment across different window definitions.

**Model equation:**
```r
# Fixed effects formula
butterfly_diff_sqrt ~ max_butterflies_t_1 + lag_duration_hours +
                      ti(wind_max_gust, sum_butterflies_direct_sun)

# Random/correlation structure (in gamm() call)
random = list(deployment_id = ~1)
correlation = corAR1(form = ~ observation_order_t | deployment_id)
```

### Partial Effects Plots

![24-Hour Window: Best Model Partial Effects](figures/24hr_partial_effects.png){width=100%}

The interaction surface is qualitatively similar to the sunset window analysis, showing comparable patterns in how wind and sun combine to predict butterfly count changes.

### Model Diagnostics

![24-Hour Window: Residual Diagnostics](figures/24hr_residual_diagnostics.png){width=100%}

**Diagnostic assessment:**

- **Residuals vs. Fitted**: Reasonably homoscedastic with no strong patterns
- **Q-Q Plot**: Residuals approximately normal
- **Scale-Location**: Variance appears stable across fitted values
- **Residuals vs. Leverage**: No problematic outliers

### Autocorrelation Diagnostics

## Window Comparison: Convergent Results

Both the sunset window (variable-length, ending at functional sunset) and 24-hour window (fixed-length, standardized duration) analyses yielded the **same best model**:

**M31: `wind_max_gust × sum_butterflies_direct_sun` (smooth interaction)**

This convergence provides strong evidence that the wind × sun interaction is robust across different temporal window definitions.

![Comparison of Wind × Sun Interaction Across Window Types](figures/window_comparison_interaction.png){width=100%}

**Key convergent findings:**

1. **Same predictor combination**: Wind gusts and sun exposure, with no main effects
2. **Same functional form**: Smooth tensor product interaction (non-linear)
3. **Simple model structure**: Interaction-only model beats all additive and complex alternatives
4. **Low overfitting risk**: Both models have reasonable df/n ratios and obs/param values
5. **Robust across windows**: Result holds for biologically-defined (sunset) and standardized (24hr) windows

**Implications:**

- The relationship between weather and roost abandonment is primarily **context-dependent**: neither wind nor sun alone predict abandonment, but their combination does
- The effect is **nonlinear**: simple additive models cannot capture the interaction
- The signal is **robust**: it emerges consistently despite differences in sample size (n=103 vs n=94) and window definition

---

## Model Fitting Notes

### Convergence

All 76 models (in both analyses) converged successfully with the following exceptions:

- Models including `wind_gust_mode` failed to converge (variable excluded)
- Full models (M71, M72) converged but flagged as high overfitting risk (df/n > 0.4)

### Computational Details

- **Software**: R 4.x, mgcv package for GAM fitting
- **Optimization**: Outer iteration with GCV/REML for smoothness selection
- **Basis dimensions**: Default k values, checked via `gam.check()`
- **AR1 correlation**: Fitted via `gamm()` using nlme correlation structures

### Data Filtering

Both analyses filtered observations to:

- `metrics_complete >= 0.95` (≥95% weather data completeness)
- Complete cases for all 5 selected predictors
- Sunset window: n = 103 → 96 after filtering
- 24-hour window: n = 94 → 94 (no additional filtering)
