## Methods

For each parameter used in the final models, I need to write some justification, or narrative of how that parameter was chosen. Each needs to be justified. Also how others were excluded. Correlation matrix will be a helpful in explaining this. Audience is someone with proficiency in GAMs and someone with experience in AIC and model selection background. These people would not want to see highly correlated variables.

Make sure it's clear that I am taking the cube root of the difference, not total abundance

Talk about the bimodality, and how it could be partially an artifact of binning. Call out the SC8 random drop,  which wasn't associated with wind or light, but it was warm enough.

Went with a short interval because it bring the environmentla conditions closer to what was acutally observed. Larger lag periods would certainly icrease the change in monarch abundance, but you are then losing a lot of information about the enviroment during that time. 30 minutes was chosen to support effort vs accuracy

We tried

## Diagnostics

Need to call out residuals plot explicitly. Specifically, the linear structure of the residuals, indicating that there is some structure taht are models are not accounting for. Refer to methods to explain how we went through many iterations trying to fix the structure
A possible explanation is that this is an artificat of the counting strategy, which was binning, which in itself is an attempt to balance effort.

## Discussion

Circle back and use my own voice to make a statement about machine learning and extracting information with that technique. Explain why I went with binning approach vs a automated classification method.
some other thoughts: 2D vs 3D structure. Low resolution image. sunlight issues. lack of training data. Probably include this in the intro and discussion. Just state what we did in the methods. Don't try to convince the reader there.

## Management implications

The results of this study indicate that we do not need to manage for wind. Indicate that real world conditions make management of temperature extremely problematic, except for using trees as shading, or the opposite. We could manage for direct sunlight. But we don't yet know what the corret light regime would be for butterflies. Using the logic we used for wind, we would predict that if direct light is disruptive, then monarchs should show abandoment.

## Light

Present it like the wind hypothesis, if
